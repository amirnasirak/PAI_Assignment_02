Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are a type of generative model that progressively corrupts data with Gaussian noise over time and learns to reverse this process to generate new samples. They optimize a variational lower bound and leverage denoising score matching to iteratively refine noisy samples. DDPMs excel in generating high-quality images, achieving state-of-the-art results
